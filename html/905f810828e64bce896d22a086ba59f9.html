          Every time a variable is declared, some bytes are allocated to that variable depending on its datatype. For example, int takes 4 bytes, a char takes only one byte. Arrays allow allocation of even larger number of storage space or "bytes". Each of these bytes has a distinct address in the main memory. Pointer is a datatype which can store this address. Hence a pointer can serve as a "reference" to the data contained other variables. This has some useful applications, most importantly, allowing users to modify data from within a function without needing to make a copy of the data, and also allowing the user to make "linked" data structures.
